# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**.

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run `composer cs`.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. First write a failing test that describes the bug, then write a fix.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Keep it Backwards Compatible** - We try to follow [semver v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not a good idea.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.

## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
